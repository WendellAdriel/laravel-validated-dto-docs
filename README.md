### Why use this package

**Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** are objects that are used to transfer data between systems. **DTOs** are typically used in applications to provide a simple, consistent format for transferring data between different parts of the application, such as **between the user interface and the business logic**.

This package provides a base **DTO Class** that can **validate** the data when creating a **DTO**. But why should we do this instead of using the standard **Request** validation?

Imagine that now you want to do the same action that you do in an endpoint on a **CLI** command per example. If your validation is linked to the Request you'll have to implement the same validation again.

With this package you **define the validation once** and can **reuse it where you need**, making your application more **maintainable** and **decoupled**.
